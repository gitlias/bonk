# BONK

Tired of villagers not giving you the right trades and wish you could just give
them a whack? Well then **BONK** is the mod for you! With this mod you can
simply *bonk* a villager in the head with any old shovel and they'll forget all
about the terrible deals they were just offering and hopefully decide to offer
something better.

Villagers who have been in the industry for a while with some trades in their
pocket aren't as easy to trick however and cannot be bonked with just some
gardening tool. But don't worry, we've got something special prepared for them!

**INTRODUCING: THE MACE**

With this flashy new 1.21 item straight from the Trial Chambers we're able to
give those stubborn villagers a real *BLAM!* and they'll forget everything
including their profession and experience.

And if you're a server admin the best news is yet to come: The mod is entirely
server-side, your players don't need to install anything!

Sounds like quite the great mod doesn't it? We're still working on a system to
encourage villagers to get a certain trade, but until then head to the
[releases page](./releases/latest) and check it out!

## TLDR;

*Bonking* a villager with a shovel will:<br>
**Cycle their offers**<br>
It will not:<br>
**Cycle their offers if they have been traded with or have no offers**

*Blamming* a villager with a mace will:<br>
**Cycle their offers, reset their experience and unlock their trades**<br>
It will not:<br>
**Make them forget they have been cured or anything not listed above**

The mod is **server-side**, players on a server don't need it installed.

Trade encouragement coming soon...
